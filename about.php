                        because you know yourself so well that you do not know where to start with.
                        Let me give a try to see what kind of image you have about me through my self-description. 
                        I hope that my impression about myself and your impression about me are not so different. Here it goes.</p>

                    <p class="card-text para-design">I am a person who is positive about every aspect of life. There are many things I like to do, to see, and to experience. 
                        I like to read, I like to write; I like to think, I like to dream; I like to talk, I like to listen. I like to see the sunrise in the morning,
                        I like to see the moonlight at night; I like to feel the music flowing on my face, I like to smell the wind coming from the ocean. 
                        I like to look at the clouds in the sky with a blank mind, I like to do thought experiment when I cannot sleep in the middle of the night. 
                        I like flowers in spring, rain in summer, leaves in autumn, and snow in winter. I like to sleep early, I like to get up late;
                        I like to be alone, I like to be surrounded by people. I like country’s peace, I like metropolis’ noise; I like the beautiful west lake in Hangzhou,
                        I like the flat cornfield in Champaign. I like delicious food and comfortable shoes;
                        I like good books and romantic movies. I like the land and the nature, I like people. And, I like to laugh.</p>
